# OSD600-Journey-on-rocky-trails
As much as I desire to become more acquainted with C++, I was truly not happy with the slow progression and outcome of this version. What was I thinking?!
I have made a version 2 on node.js.
- NOTE: Because of the reason above the file ConsoleApplicationOSD600 has code no longer needed. Since we are still at the beginning of the class and it is hard to remove files form a commit I had to leave it THE WORKING CODE IS IN THE FOLDER: CommandToolLinkCheck
- Can run with the v or version argument to get the current version of the command line tool
