# OSD600-Journey-on-rocky-trails
As much as I desire to become more acquainted with C++, I was truly not happy with the slow progression and outcome of this version. What was I thinking?!
I have made a version 2 on node.js.

Clone CommandLinkToolCheck since this is the successful version.

  Install project dependencies:

   npm install

   npm install node-fetch

   npm install colors

   Run command:  node index.js argv.html
   

Features:

Prints good Urls in green and prints broken Urls in red.
